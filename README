This directory is the main development trunk for the Ontology of Microbial
Phenotypes (OMP). Files are named as follows:

omp-edit.obo - Editors' version of OMP. This is a working copy and should not be considered stable. Stable releases of OMP are in the releases directory.

archived_files - Do not use these files. They exist only for archival reasons.
	microbial_phenotypes.obo - previous version of OMP, now deprecated. Upon
commits to version r75 and r76, this file became omp.obo and omp-edit.obo.

Other files:
The deprecated file "microbial_observable_ontology" was previously removed
(r23).
