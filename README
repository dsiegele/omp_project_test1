date? This was a test of migrating the ontology files from SourceForge to github.  This attempt successfully transferred trunk, but did not capture the releases.

2015-10-05 Testing how to update the release files.  First, added omp.obo from 2015-06-12. Next, will try to update to the 2015-09-07 file. This is what I did:
  -clone repository again after adding the omp.obo file
  -replace omp.obo 2015-06-12 with omp.obo 2015-09-08
  -stage the modified file with the command  $:git commit -a -m 'omp.obo 2015-09-08'
  -push file to git hub with the command $:git push origin master
