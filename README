date? This was a test of migrating the ontology files from SourceForge to github.  This attempt successfully transferred trunk, but did not capture the releases.

2015-10-05 Testing how to update the release files.  
First, I added omp.obo from 2015-06-12 to the repository. 
Next, I recloned the repository (so my local copy would match the remote version).  Then I:
  -replaced omp.obo 2015-06-12 with omp.obo 2015-09-08
  -staged the modified file with the command  $ git commit -a -m 'omp.obo 2015-09-08'
  -pushed file to git hub with the command $ git push origin master
Finally, I tagged the commit as a new release 
  -added a name for the tag with the command $ git tag -a release_2015-09-08 f83c04c391ac929350f7f69efa51c0bb3251d38a 
      (the editor opens and you can add text to the file. I add the date of the release, e.g. release_2015-09-08.) 
  - to check that you've added the tag, run the command $git tag 
  -pushed the release to the remote repository with the command $ git push origin release_2015-09-08
  -check tags branch on github and see if the tag is there
