This directory is the main development trunk for the Ontology of Microbial
Phenotypes (OMP). Files are named as follows:

omp.obo - Main stable release file of OMP. This is the version we recommend for
most users.

omp-edit.obo - Editors version of OMP. This file is periodically released as
omp.obo, but it is also a working copy and should not be considered stable.

microbial_phenotypes.obo - previous version of OMP, now deprecated. Upon
commits to version r75 and r76, this file became omp.obo and omp-edit.obo. Do
not use this file any longer. It exists only for archival reasons. 

Other files:
The deprecated file "microbial_observable_ontology" was previously removed
(r23).
