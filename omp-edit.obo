def: "A microbial phenotype that is used as a reference point by which to compare the phenotypic attributes of another cell or group of cells." [OMP:MCC]
comment: Many observed phenotypes, such exhibiting an increase or a decrease in a particular process or quality, can only be understood in the context of comparison to a reference phenotype. We call the phenotype to which a comparison is being made a reference phenotype, and we consider the phenotype resulting from this comparison a relative phenotype. A second category of phenotypes, called state phenotypes, reflects the inherent capability of a representative member of a taxonomic unit. It is possible to asses state phenotypes in absence of a reference. For example, some organisms are motile, while others are non-motile, both of which can be assessed independent of comparison to a second phenotype.

def: "An antimicrobial compound resistance phenotype, where the trait in question is resistance to a macrolide drug.  Macrolides contain a macrolide ring--a large lactone ring with multiple keto and hydroxyl groups--linked to one or more sugars." [ISBN:9780073375267, OMP:MCC]
comment: Macrolide antibiotics are effective inhibitors of bacterial protein biosynthesis. They bind to the large 50S ribosomal subunit at or near the peptidyl transferase center and block the elongation of the peptide chain.
