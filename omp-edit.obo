def: "An antimicrobial compound resistance phenotype, where the trait in question is resistance to a macrolide drug.  Macrolides contain a macrolide ring--a large lactone ring with multiple keto and hydroxyl groups--linked to one or more sugars." [ISBN:9780073375267, OMP:MCC]
comment: Macrolide antibiotics are effective inhibitors of bacterial protein biosynthesis. They bind to the large 50S ribosomal subunit at or near the peptidyl transferase center and block the elongation of the peptide chain.
